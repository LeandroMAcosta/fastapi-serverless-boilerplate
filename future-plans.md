# 🚀 Future Plans: Serverless Framework with FastAPI + React + AWS + Terraform

Designing a serverless framework around **FastAPI**, **React**, **AWS**, and **Terraform** with multi-stage support and domain-separated Lambda functions — optimized for scalability, maintainability, and developer experience.

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

### 🧱 Backend (FastAPI)
- Domain-based Lambda functions (e.g., `/user`, `/ride`, `/payment`)
- Use [Mangum](https://github.com/jordaneremieff/mangum) to wrap FastAPI for Lambda
- Use **Lambda Layers** for:
  - `aws_lambda_powertools`
  - Shared dependencies (DB clients, auth utils)

### 🌐 Frontend (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- Hosted via **S3 + CloudFront**
- **Terraform** for infrastructure deployment
- **CI/CD** deploys different builds per stage: `dev`, `staging`, `prod`

### ⚙️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Modular Terraform structure
- Stage separation via workspaces or variable files
- Reusable modules for VPC, Cognito, API Gateway, etc.

---

## ✅ Checklist

### 1. 📁 Project Structure
- Monorepo layout:

```bash
/infra/terraform/
  ├── modules/
  ├── dev/
  ├── prod/
/backend/
  ├── user/
  ├── payment/
  ├── ride/
/frontend/
  ... tbd
```

I can use tools like Taskfile, Makefile, or npm scripts to simplify multi-stage deployments.

### 2. Terraform Considerations
- Use workspaces or separate state files for stages
- Tag resources with:
  - stage
  - domain
  - owner
- Use modules for reusable infra (Lambda, Gateway, Cognito, etc.)
- Automate packaging/deploying Lambdas via Terraform external or null_resource

Be careful with:
- Circular dependencies (API → Lambda → Layer → S3 zip → Terraform state)
- Race conditions in Lambda + Layer updates

### 3. Lambda Functions (Domain Split)
Each domain (user, payment, etc.) is a separate FastAPI app.

Each function:
- `handler.py` with Mangum
- Has own `requirements.txt` (or consolidated Layer)
- Logs structured events using AWS Lambda Powertools
- Has domain-specific IAM roles (principle of least privilege)
- Has versioning via Terraform or CI/CD (e.g., semantic release)

### 4. Lambda Layers
Use layers to avoid repeating dependencies like:
- aws-lambda-powertools
- sqlalchemy, boto3, etc.
- Your own internal shared code (auth, error handling)

Use pinned versions and build them in a Docker container matching Lambda's runtime (public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.11 for example).

### 5. API Gateway (HTTP API)
Central API Gateway with path-based routing to each Lambda.

Example:
- `/user/*` → user lambda
- `/payment/*` → payment lambda

Ensure:
- CORS correctly configured
- Stage variables or stage-specific deployments

### 6. Cognito Integration
- One Cognito User Pool per stage
- Use Cognito Authorizer in API Gateway for protected routes
- Store access tokens and ID tokens in frontend securely
- Backend Lambdas decode & verify tokens (consider caching keys with JWKs)

Common mistakes to avoid:
- Misconfigured callback URLs in Cognito App Clients
- Not rotating refresh tokens
- Forgetting to scope API Gateway routes

### 7. Monitoring & Logging
Use AWS Lambda Powertools features:
- Tracer (X-Ray integration)
- Logger (structured logging, JSON)
- Metrics (CloudWatch embedded metrics)

Also:
- Enable X-Ray for Lambda and API Gateway
- Use structured logs for better parsing in CloudWatch Insights
- Consider custom dashboards (e.g., using CloudWatch Dashboard + Terraform or Grafana with AWS Metrics)

### 8. Frontend (React + Tailwind + TypeScript)
- Hosted in S3 and served via CloudFront
- Use `aws s3 sync` or Terraform to deploy
- Separate buckets per stage
- `.env` files for stage-specific API URLs and Cognito App Client IDs

CDN invalidation is crucial when deploying changes:
```bash
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ABC123 --paths "/*"
```

### 9. CI/CD (Optional but Recommended)
Set up pipelines for:
- Backend domain deployments (per folder)
- Frontend deployment (React build + S3 sync + invalidate CDN)
- Infra deployment (Terraform plan/apply per workspace)

Tools:
- GitHub Actions
- CircleCI
- CodePipeline + CodeBuild (if staying 100% AWS)

Use pre-commit hooks for linting, formatting, and Terraform validation.

### 🔐 10. Security
- Apply least privilege IAM roles per Lambda
- API Gateway auth with Cognito + additional scopes if needed
- Store secrets in AWS Parameter Store or Secrets Manager
- Encrypt everything at rest and in transit
- Enable logging and alerts for suspicious activities

### 🧪 11. Local Development & Testing
- Use Docker + Uvicorn to run FastAPI locally per domain
- Mock Cognito using tools like localstack or implement a simple stub for local testing
- Consider pytest, coverage, moto for backend tests
- CI should run tests before any Lambda deployment


**Total**: ~$5–$10/month/stage (mostly in free tier if under 1M users/month)

### ⚠️ Gotchas & Watchouts
- Mangum doesn't support all FastAPI features (e.g., background tasks)
- Cold starts are higher when using large Layers — optimize zip sizes
- Terraform and Lambda zipping can get messy — automate builds cleanly
- Cognito token verification errors (make sure clock skew is handled)
- CORS misconfiguration breaks frontend → backend integration
- Logging verbosity → can balloon CloudWatch costs quickly

### ✅ Final Thoughts
Building a production-grade serverless framework, which means:
- Think modular: everything (code, infra, pipelines)
- Optimize for DX: fast local test loops and deploys
- Secure and observe: logs, metrics, tracing, alerts
- Version everything: APIs, layers, backend domains
